# Containerized Python Application

This project is a containerized Python application that processes a sample dataset. It is structured to run in a Docker environment and includes all necessary configurations for setup and execution.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── app.py               # Main application script
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile           # Docker configuration
└── sample_data.csv      # Sample dataset used by the application
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t container_app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm container_app
   ```

## Application Overview

- The main logic resides in `app.py`, which utilizes the `sample_data.csv` file.
- All Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and will be installed during Docker image build.
- This setup is ideal for deployment in isolated environments using Docker.
