Docker Bind Mounts on Windows
Overview
This repository demonstrates how to use Docker bind mounts on Windows to persist and share data between a container and the host system. Bind mounts allow you to directly map a folder from your Windows machine into a Docker container.

Introduction
Bind mounts allow a Windows host folder to be directly mapped into a running Docker container. This is useful for:

Sharing data between the host and container.
Live development, where file changes on Windows reflect in the container instantly.
Persistent storage, ensuring that container data is not lost when stopped.
Unlike Docker volumes, bind mounts use existing directories from the host filesystem, offering more flexibility.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have:

Docker Desktop installed on Windows (Download here).
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) enabled (recommended for better performance).
A folder created on your Windows machine to use as a bind mount.
Creating a Bind Mount
Step 1: Create a Directory
On Windows, open PowerShell and create a folder for the bind mount:

powershell
Copy
Edit
mkdir C:\docker_bind_mount
Set-Content C:\docker_bind_mount\testfile.txt "Hello from Arnab!"
This will create C:\docker_bind_mount and add a file testfile.txt inside it with the content "Hello from Arnab!".

Using a Bind Mount in the Arnab Container
Step 2: Run a Container with a Bind Mount
Now, start a container named Arnab container using the bind mount:

powershell
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name arnab_container -v C:\docker_bind_mount:/data busybox
--name arnab_container → Assigns the name Arnab container to the container.
-v C:\docker_bind_mount:/data → Maps C:\docker_bind_mount from Windows to /data inside the container.
busybox → A lightweight Linux-based container.
Accessing and Verifying Data
Step 3: Enter the Arnab Container
To check if the mount worked, open a shell inside the running container:

powershell
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it arnab_container sh
Once inside the container, list the /data directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
ls /data
You should see testfile.txt. Now, display its contents:

sh
Copy
Edit
cat /data/testfile.txt
It should print:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Hello from Arnab!
Removing the Bind Mount
Step 4: Stop and Remove the Arnab Container
powershell
Copy
Edit
docker stop arnab_container
docker rm arnab_container
The data inside C:\docker_bind_mount remains even after the container is removed.

To delete the folder manually:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\docker_bind_mount
Common Issues and Fixes
Issue	Possible Fix
Bind mount not working	Ensure that Docker Desktop has access to your drive. Go to Settings → Resources → File Sharing and add C: if not listed.
Permission denied	Run PowerShell as Administrator and retry the command.
Files not appearing inside the container	Try using /host_mnt/c/... inside WSL-based Docker (e.g., -v /host_mnt/c/docker_bind_mount:/data).
Container cannot access mounted files	Ensure the folder is not read-only in Windows Explorer.
Conclusion
Bind mounts provide a powerful way to connect Windows directories with Docker containers, allowing real-time file sharing and persistence. Compared to Docker volumes, bind mounts offer more control over the host filesystem but require proper setup.

📖 Introduction
Docker bind mounts allow a Windows host folder to be directly mapped into a running Docker container. This is useful for:

✅ Sharing data between the host and container.
✅ Live development, where file changes on Windows reflect in the container instantly.
✅ Persistent storage, ensuring that container data is not lost when stopped.

Unlike Docker volumes, bind mounts use existing directories from the host filesystem, offering more flexibility.

⚙️ Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have:

🔹 Docker Desktop installed on Windows.
🔹 Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) enabled (recommended for better performance).
🔹 A folder created on your Windows machine to use as a bind mount.

📂 Creating a Bind Mount
🛠️ Step 1: Create a Directory
Open PowerShell and create a folder for the bind mount:

powershell
Copy
Edit
mkdir C:\docker_bind_mount
Set-Content C:\docker_bind_mount\testfile.txt "Hello from Arnab!"
📌 This creates C:\docker_bind_mount and adds a file testfile.txt inside it with the content "Hello from Arnab!".

🐳 Using a Bind Mount in the Arnab Container
🛠️ Step 2: Run a Container with a Bind Mount
Run the following command to start a container named Arnab container:

powershell
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name arnab_container -v C:\docker_bind_mount:/data busybox
📝 Explanation:
✔ --name arnab_container → Assigns the name Arnab container to the container.
✔ -v C:\docker_bind_mount:/data → Maps C:\docker_bind_mount from Windows to /data inside the container.
✔ busybox → A lightweight Linux-based container.

🔍 Accessing and Verifying Data
🛠️ Step 3: Enter the Arnab Container
To check if the bind mount is working, open a shell inside the running container:

powershell
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it arnab_container sh
Once inside the container, list the /data directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
ls /data
You should see testfile.txt. Now, display its contents:

sh
Copy
Edit
cat /data/testfile.txt
✅ Expected Output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Hello from Arnab!
🗑️ Removing the Bind Mount
🛠️ Step 4: Stop and Remove the Arnab Container
To stop and remove the container:

powershell
Copy
Edit
docker stop arnab_container
docker rm arnab_container
📌 The data inside C:\docker_bind_mount remains even after the container is removed.

To delete the folder manually:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\docker_bind_mount
